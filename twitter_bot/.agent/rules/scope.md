# Scope Rule

- Work ONLY inside the `twitter_bot/` directory.
- Do NOT modify or access parent directories.
- Do NOT move `main.py`.
- Do NOT rename existing files.
- New files may be created inside `twitter_bot/` only.

Security:
- Never print or log secrets (API keys, tokens).
- Never add real credentials into the repository.
