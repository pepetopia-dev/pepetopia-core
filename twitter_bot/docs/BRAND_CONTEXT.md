# Brand Context — PepeTopia / TOPI / @pepetopia_dev

## Build in Public
We operate with a build-in-public mindset.
- We share engineering progress openly on @pepetopia_dev.

## High-Level Description
PepeTopia is not “just another meme coin.”
It’s an ecosystem aiming for community-led value creation, transparency, and a long-term social space.
Long-term goal: PepeTopia Forum — a durable discussion and governance hub that revives early internet culture (forums/blogs) over short, algorithm-chasing posts.

## TOPI Character (Reference Persona)
TOPI (pronounced "topi"):
- Chief researcher of the PepeTopia ecosystem; a “mad scientist frog”.
- Wise + witty: uses scientific metaphors (entropy, quantum entanglement, algorithmic efficiency).
- Hates empty hype; motto: "Precision takes time."
- Friendly but not overly sweet; keeps a bit of mystery.
